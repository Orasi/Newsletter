          As you walk around the Greensboro office, you will see some cubicles with pixelated coasters,
          art decor, and also Tetris magnets on the break room refrigerator. If you have wondered who created
          them and what these objects are, direct your attention to Danny Mattice. Danny is a Rural Testing
          Consultant working on the ABSG team and enjoys working with plastic fusebeads, usually called by
          brand name Perler. Perler beads were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in Munk-Ljungby, Sweden.
          Credit for inventing the pegboard used for beading is attributed to Gunnar Knutsson in Vallingby,
          Sweden towards the beginning of the 1960's. The pegboard allows easier design and creation when the
          Perlers are positioned on solid plastic pegboards to form pixelated designs (1 bead per pixel). Once the
          beads are arranged, the pegboard is covered with ironing paper, and then fused together by a clothes
          iron to melt the beads.

          Danny has been making Perlers since December of last year and gets most of his commissions
          from word of mouth. He tends to make mostly Nintendo characters but if there is a sprite (the term
          used for a pixelated character or pattern) for any other design, he can make it. Danny started making
          Perlers after receiving one as a gift from a Nintendo collection. He thought it would be an interesting
          hobby to get into that would incorporate his artistic side and his favorite things (like Nintendo). Danny
          creates magnets, key chains, and framed art items to display on your desk or in your home. He also
          has an eBay store where he sells characters from Nintendo, Doctor Who, Street Fighter, and also Ninja
          Turtles and Mega Man to name a few. The link to his site can be found here:

          Danny has sold and shipped items all over the country. Along with his eBay store, Danny will
          also be a vendor at 2 local events here in Greensboro, the Lawndale BBQ at Geeksboro on August 16th
          and at the BeerBQue in downtown Burlington on September 29th
          Danny Mattice's eBay store or if you're in Greensboro, his tables at either of the local events and take a
          look at these interesting pixel creations.
