    %h3 Race The Bar: Beer Mile - Saturday, September 20
    %span
      This event is more for competitive drinkers than for runners. One Mile of running (most might be walking or
      stumbling and that's ok with us) and 4 drinking stations along the course (every 1/4 mile). You must drink ONE
      4oz beer at each drinking station - that equals 16 oz. of beer plus one mile of running.
