  As you walk around the Greensboro office, you will see some cubicles with pixelated coasters,
  art decor, and also Tetris magnets on the break room refrigerator. If you have wondered who created
  them and what these objects are, direct your attention to Danny Mattice. Danny is a Rural Testing
  Consultant working on the ABSG team and enjoys working with plastic fusebeads, usually called by
  brand name Perler. Perler beads were introduced in 1958 by Munkplast AB in Munk-Ljungby, Sweden.
  Credit for inventing the pegboard used for beading is attributed to Gunnar Knutsson in Vallingby,
  Sweden towards the beginning of the 1960's. The pegboard allows easier design and creation when the
  Perlers are positioned on solid plastic pegboards to form pixelated designs (1 bead per pixel). Once the
  beads are arranged, the pegboard is covered with ironing paper, and then fused together by a clothes
  iron to melt the beads.

  Danny has been making Perlers since December of last year and gets most of his commissions
  from word of mouth. He tends to make mostly Nintendo characters but if there is a sprite (the term
  used for a pixelated character or pattern) for any other design, he can make it. Danny started making
  Perlers after receiving one as a gift from a Nintendo collection. He thought it would be an interesting
  hobby to get into that would incorporate his artistic side and his favorite things (like Nintendo). Danny
  creates magnets, key chains, and framed art items to display on your desk or in your home. He also
  has an eBay store where he sells characters from Nintendo, Doctor Who, Street Fighter, and also Ninja
  Turtles and Mega Man to name a few. The link to his site can be found here:
