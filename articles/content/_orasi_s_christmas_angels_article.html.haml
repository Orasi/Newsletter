  Each year Orasi brings Christmas joy to a dozen or so school children through the Christmas Angels program.  Counselors in local schools identify underprivileged students (the “Angels”) and present their needs to nearby churches.  These churches, in turn, appeal to their members and area businesses to grant the students’ Christmas wishes.  This year Orasi’s angels came primarily from one elementary school.  Because our angels were all relatively young, the first gifts purchased were a bicycle and helmet for each child.  After that, we made sure everyone had a warm coat and then we did our best to provide the rest of the gifts on their Christmas lists.

  This is made possible by the Orasi employees who donate to the Orasi Charitable Fund through automatic payroll deduction.  If you are not involved in this program but would like to be, please email <a href="mailto:april.hull@orasi.com?Subject=Orasi's Christmas Angels">April Hull</a> and let her know how much you would like to contribute each pay period.  No amount is too small!  When we all give a little it adds up to a lot, and children who would otherwise have a very bleak Christmas are blessed with a merry one instead.  Thank you for your generosity and, in the words of Tiny Tim, “God bless us everyone!”
