  Driven by customer needs and changes in the market, Orasi is working to develop an approach to stay abreast of current and upcoming technologies and testing methodologies, including solutions outside of the HP world.  Paul Atkins is organizing and facilitating this initiative and has built programing language-based teams, the 4 main languages being Java, C#, Ruby, and Python.  Each team's aim is to explore different frameworks, tools, and methodologies to build and support automated testing.  The objective is to cultivate skills and knowledge around many of the processes related to Continuous Delivery and Agile Methodologies, including many of the open source tools.

  The end goal is to build a knowledge and support base available to the entire company that will include help, advice, training, documentation, staffing and such.  Those who have joined in this initiative come from a variety of departments across Orasi: Rural Testing (Greensboro and Atlanta), Mobile Testing, MPT, SAP, and others.  Most of the team members are currently assigned to billable projects, but are volunteering their down time and after hours time to contribute to the learning and research.  Perry Thomas, Adam Thomas, Lew Gordon, Matt Watson, and Jessica Marshall have been identified as leads to maintain the group's focus and organization.  They meet weekly with Paul to share what they are learning and to demonstrate some of the solutions being developed.
