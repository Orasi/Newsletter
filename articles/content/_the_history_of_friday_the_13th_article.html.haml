  An estimated 7% of Americans suffer from paraskevidekatriaphobia.  It isn’t a virus, a type of cancer or even an addiction.  Paraskevidekatriaphobia is the fear of Friday the 13th - a fear so pervasive in our society that many people refuse to go to work on that day, many others will not fly, and almost no one will set a wedding on that date.  To most of us it’s just another day on the calendar.  So, why all the fuss?  Good question!

  There are various myths about the number 13 being not just unlucky, but deadly. For example, one myth is that if 13 people dine together one of them will die within a year.  This likely originated from at least one of two sources: 1) the Last Supper - when Jesus dined with the 12 Apostles (13 people total) and only hours later was killed; and 2) a popular Norse legend in which Odin dined with 11 friends only to have Loki, the god of evil and turmoil (and person #13), crash the party with deadly results.  The number 13 is so feared in America that many tall buildings do not have a 13th floor, many cities that have a 12th Street and a 14th Street do not have a 13th Street, and most hospitals do not have a Room 13.

  Friday has its share of PR problems as well.  Many consider Friday to be “cursed” because that’s the day on which Jesus was crucified.  Geoffrey Chaucer, in his 14th Century magnum opus The Canterbury Tales, branded Friday an unlucky day on which to begin journeys or new projects. That may have contributed to a longstanding superstition among seamen that setting sail on Fridays is unlucky.  To dispel that belief, one hundred years ago the British government specially commissioned a ship and gave her the name "H.M.S. Friday."  They laid her keel on a Friday, launched her on a Friday, selected her crew on a Friday, and even hired a man named Jim Friday to be her captain.  To top it off, H.M.S. Friday embarked on her maiden voyage on a Friday — and was never seen or heard from again.

  So when did Friday the 13th become the anxiety-inducing phenomenon it is today?  Other than an obscure reference in a biography of Gioachino Rossini (composer of The William Tell Overture and The Barber of Seville), Friday and 13 weren’t really combined in literature until 1907 when Thomas W. Lawson’s novel Friday, the Thirteenth was published.  In this book, a corrupt stockbroker uses the Friday the 13th superstition to create a panic on Wall Street.  Obviously Friday the 13th was a dreaded day for many by the time this book hit the shelves, but when exactly it took on its terrifying persona we may never know.
