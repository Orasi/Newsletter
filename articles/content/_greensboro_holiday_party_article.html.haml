  For the second year in a row the Greensboro Holiday party was held on December 11th at the PorterHouse Bar and Grill .   The evening was filled with great food, great drinks, and of course, dancing.  There was a Secret Santa gift exchange and even a raffle which included Apple TVs as prizes and a Grand Prize of cash.   A great time was had by all in attendance and we look forward to the next Holiday party.
