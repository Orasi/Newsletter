  With our winter climate in Georgia and North Carolina, our states are not very tropical plant
  friendly. In fact, I bet many of you have never even considered growing a tropical fruit at home,
  although if you follow along I will show you how easy it is to grow your own delicious pineapple from the
  comfort of your own home.

  Before we get to it, let's take a look at where and how pineapples grow. When you think of
  the pineapple, I bet many of you think instantly of Hawaii. In fact, major growers Dole and Del Monte
  formerly had massive operations on the islands, but with lower costs and better transportation options
  elsewhere these companies no longer export from Hawaii; Del Monte even closed its entire operation
  there. Today most pineapples are grown in and exported from the tropics of Costa Rica. So, what type
  of fruit is pineapple? A pineapple plant is a member of the Bromeliad family of plants. Bromeliads are
  common tropical houseplants - which will often look like the top of a pineapple with red or yellow leaves
  at the crown. Bromeliads are also a hardy plant, and while they are unable to survive outside during our
  winters, they require very little care. Now that you know that, let's get started.

  Step One: Picking the Perfect Pineapple to grow your own (from the store). To find the perfect
  pineapple in the store you will want to locate a firm green or golden pineapple (color has little to do
  with selection), with a healthy looking top (no brown or discolored leaves), and you can also smell the
  bottom of a pineapple to see if you can detect the sweet smell. For the purpose of planting, you will
  want to give a little tug on the leaves of the crown and also make sure there is no sign of mold at the
  bottom of the fruit. If the leaves are easily pulled from the crown, put it back and locate one that the
  leaves can be pulled without being torn off the crown.

  Step Two: Removing the crown from the fruit. The crown of the pineapple will become your
  own pineapple plant! To remove, simply twist the crown off of the plant. Set the crown to the side for a
  couple of hours and enjoy your pineapple.

  Step Three: Remove the bottom leaves from the crown. Simply pull down on the leaves at
  the bottom of the plant as though you are peeling them off. You may notice some small roots already
  forming, but if not there is nothing to worry about. Strip the leaves until you have about a half an inch of
  bare stalk at the bottom. You will also need to remove any of the fruit that was attached to the bottom
  when you twisted off the pineapple top. Do so carefully with a sharp knife by slicing it from the stalk.

  Step Four: Rooting your plant. Taking a small see-through cup, place a small amount of room
  temperature water in the bottom. Place your pineapple so that the remaining leaves rest on the rim
  and keep the leaves at the bottom out of the water (only a portion of the bare stalk should be touching
  the water). Keep the plant near a window, but not in direct sun light. After a few days to a week you
  should notice some roots beginning to form. You may need to change the water if it looks dirty or is no
  longer touching the bottom of the plant.

  Step Five: Potting the plant. Now that you have some roots, it is time for a pot. While any pot
  will work, you will need to ensure that the pot has good drainage so that the plant will not continuously
  sit in water after you have watered it. Fill the pot with damp potting mix making a hole in the center for
  your plant. Be sure to pack the soil around the base so the plant is secure and ensure that no leaves are
  buried in the soil.

  Step Six: Care and Maintenance. During the summer months the plant may be placed outside
  (when moving the plant outside, start off in a semi shaded spot to avoid leaf burn), the plant may also
  be outside during Spring and Fall but will need to be moved inside if nighttime temps dip below 45 degrees
  F. Water the plant when the soil appears dry, usually once a week, but be sure to avoid over watering
  as this may cause root rot. You may fertilize your plant with any household fertilizer for garden plants
  (Miracle Grow, etc.) every 3 weeks. You can start out with a large pot from the beginning, but if you do
  not, you will need to continue to transplant your pineapple as it grows.

  Step Seven: Waiting on a Pineapple. This is often the hardest part of growing one! With
  a healthy dose of patience it can be done. My first pineapple plant took FOUR years to produce.
  Theoretically you could see a bright red "cone" growing in the center of the leaves of your plant within a
  year. Due to our climate, the natural way takes a little longer than 12 months. If you are impatient, you
  can trick the plant into producing, although the quality of your fruit may not be as good as it could be if
  you let it naturally produce.

  Step Seven B: Forcing a pineapple to produce. I have not tried this method but according to Dole
  you can force your pineapple to grow by doing the following 14 months after you initially planted your
  pineapple. Place the entire plant, pot and all, in a large plastic bag with a ripe apple and leave for three
  days in shady spot. After the third day, remove the plastic bag, and return the plant to its normal sunny
  location. You should see the cone forming in eight to nine weeks after that.

  Step Eight: Harvesting the pineapple. From the time the "cone" appears in the center until
  harvest should be about six months. During those six months, the pineapple will make a great
  conversation piece and you should get some satisfaction from watching it transform before your eyes.
  After all, you grew it! Once the pineapple turns golden yellow it is time to harvest. Cut and enjoy! Your
  main plant will produce 3-4 more pineapples over time, but will produce lots more plants itself. You can
  also start the process all over again from your fresh pineapple.

  Hint: Your plant can become quite large over time! My first planted pineapple has produced two
  delicious pineapples and has grown to about 6 feet wide by 4-5 feet tall in the 7 years since I planted it.
