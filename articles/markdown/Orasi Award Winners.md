Every quarter during the Orasi year we take a moment to recognize those individuals who consistently go above and beyond the call of duty; not only on their Project but their Orasi careers. While we may only take a few moments during each meeting to recognize these individuals, it certainly does not reflect the long hours, arduous work effort and sacrifices the individuals have made to complete a deadline to meet and exceed a customer’s expectations. It is these individuals that put the “Quality” in Quality Assurance Testing. Thank you for what you do and congratulations to the Quarter 1 – Quarter 3 Award Winners!
