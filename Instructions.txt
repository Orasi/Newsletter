Development flow:
1. Clone the repository to one of the following
	a. your computer
	b. a new instance in Cloud9
2. Create a new branch in git for development of the new edition
3. Create the website structure
	a. replace the contents of 'article_list' with the current list of articles
		i. the list should be in the format 'Article Title|||Article Author'
		ii. this list should be in the order the articles should appear
		iii. put a '#' at the beginning of any article line that you dont' want to process yet(useful for creating placeholders)
	b. place any markdown files in 'content/markdown'. These file names should exactly match the article titles they are associated with.
	c. run the 'rake' command to build a new, local version of the site
4. Build the new edition
	a. adjust/add content of the haml article files in 'articles/content'
	b. run the 'rake' command again to update your local version of the site with the changes
	c. preview the new version to verify the changes
	c. if the changes are acceptable, commit them to git
	d. repeat until website is complete
5. Publish development version to the staging location of the website via Capistrano
	a. follow the instructions at the top of '../config/deploy/staging.rb'
	b. make any necessary changes
	c. commit the changes and repeat until website is finalized
6. Publish finalized version to the production location of the website via Capistrano
	a. merge the development branch into the master branch on git
	b. follow the instructions at the top of '../config/deploy/staging.rb'
	c. verify the live site is correct
	d. celebrate!
7. Delete unnecessary data in articles/archive


IMPORTANT: Steps 5 and 6 cannot be completed unless your are working from
an account on a computer that has SSH access to the web server in Atlanta @ 69.61.108.36.
To get access, talk to Matt Watson or Perry Thomas.

Project structure:
/articles/articles.yml	|	this file contains a list of all the article titles with author information and the various article flags: no_gallery, hidden, page_name. Rake uses this to generate all of the article html files.
/articles/content		|	this folder contains the .haml content file for each article. Each article must be listed in /article/articles.yml or it won't be processed by Rake.

Terms & Concepts:
Git
Rake
Capistrano
SSH
Staging vs. Production
Haml
Sass


ToDo:
-create guide for website design so others can develop
-define terms and concepts

to access Atlanta server:
ssh damien@69.61.108.36

to deploy to stage with your current branch:
bundle exec cap staging deploy

to deploy to production with the master branch:
bundle exec cap production deploy

make changes to index page in:
index.html.erb

bylines are handled in _grid_layout.html.haml

each article should have a haml file with the article contents in articles/content
articles/articles.yml
	controls the order of the articles
	controls what articles are visible on the page
	controls what articles get built

ToDo:
read up on Puppet(used to administrate a Linux box remotely)
