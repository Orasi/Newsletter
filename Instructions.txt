Get help from Jock, he might know more about front end stuff
figure out why Alissa isn;t geting merge request emails
Notes from Meeting with Lewis:use 'rake' to create the website from the contentsÂ 
test it locally to verify it works, may have to run rake multiple times
	---use 'bundle exec cap production deploy' to push the generated files to the server---
		alternatively, use 'bundle exec cap production deploy | tee cap_log.txt' to record 
verify the live site looks good
live website files are accessible in /vars/www/rural-reader/q1/current (this is controlled by the :deploy_to variable in the deploy.rb)

	each article should have a haml file with the article contents in articles/content
	articles/articles.yml controls the order of the articles and what is visible

ToDo:
	Ask Lew what tells the webserver to pull the files from var/www/rural-reader/2015/q1/current and how to change that to q2
		- has to do with symlinks, reference email from Lew
		-For the question fix the symlink under rural-directory for rural_reader.  To do this just `rm rural_reader` then use ` ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink` for example `ln -s /var/www/rural-reader/2015/q1/current rural_reader`. 
	go through past Rural Readers to understand all the different areas, like the find and seek
	go through each folder/file in the repo to understand what they do.
