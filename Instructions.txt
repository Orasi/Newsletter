    claymation thing with the logo is too slow

Get help from Jock, he might know more about front end stuff
figure out why Alissa isn;t geting merge request emails
Notes from Meeting with Lewis:use 'rake' to create the website from the contents 
test it locally to verify it works, may have to run rake multiple times
	use 'bundle exec cap production deploy' to push the generated files to the server
	verify the live site looks good
	live website files are accessible in /vars/www/rural-reader/q1/current (this is controlled by the :deploy_to variable in the deploy.rb)
	each article should have a haml file with the article contents in articles/content
	articles/articles.yml controls the order of the articles and what is visible
	getting an issue when deploying about not being able to delete items in one of the release folders
	need to show this to Lew and get permissions fixed before he heads out
ToDo:
	get Lew to fix permissions for deploy issue - done
	Ask Lew what tells the webserver to pull the files from var/www/rural-reader/2015/q1/current and how to change that to q2
		- has to do with symlinks, reference email from Lew
	figure out how to generate files for q2 with rake
	the target folder is controlled in deploy.rb
	create a clean template for starting each quarter? 
	go through past Rural Readers to understand all the different areas, like the find and seek
	go through each folder/file in the repo to understand what they do.
